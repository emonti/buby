include_class 'BurpExtender'

# Buby is a mash-up of the commercial security testing web proxy PortSwigger 
# Burp Suite(tm) allowing you to add scripting to Burp. Burp is driven from 
# and tied to JRuby with a Java extension using the BurpExtender API.
#
# The Buby class is an abstract implementation of a BurpExtender ruby handler. 
# Included are several abstract event handlers used from the BurpExtender
# java implementation:
# * evt_extender_init
# * evt_proxy_message
# * evt_command_line_args
# * evt_register_callbacks
# * evt_application_closing
#
# Buby also supports the newer event handlers available in Burp 1.2.09 and up:
# * evt_http_message
# * evt_scan_issue
#
#
# This class also exposes several methods to access Burp functionality 
# and user interfaces through the IBurpExtenderCallbacks interface 
# (note, several abbreviated aliases also exist for each):
# * doActiveScan
# * doPassiveScan
# * excludeFromScope
# * includeInScope
# * isInScope
# * issueAlert
# * makeHttpRequest
# * sendToIntruder
# * sendToRepeater
# * sendToSpider
#
# Buby also provides front-end ruby methods for the various callback methods 
# supported by Burp. New callbacks have been cropping up in newer Burp versions
# frequently. 
# 
# Available since Burp 1.2.09:
# * getProxyHistory
# * getSiteMap
# * restoreState
# * saveState
# * getParameters
# * getHeaders
#
# Available since Burp 1.2.15:
# * getScanIssues
#
# Available since Burp 1.2.17:
# * exitSuite
#
# If you wish to access any of the IBurpExtenderCallbacks methods directly. 
# You can use 'burp_callbacks' to obtain a reference.

  # Below are the parameters descriptions based on the IBurpExtender 
  # javadoc. Where applicable, decriptions have been modified for 
  # local parameter naming and other ruby-specific details added.
  #
  # * msg_ref:
  #   An identifier which is unique to a single request/response pair. This 
  #   can be used to correlate details of requests and responses and perform 
  #   processing on the response message accordingly. This number also 
  #   corresponds to the Burp UI's proxy "history" # column.
  #
  # * is_req: (true/false)
  #   Flags whether the message is a client request or a server response.
  #
  # * rhost:
  #   The hostname of the remote HTTP server.
  #
  # * rport:
  #   The port of the remote HTTP server.
  #
  # * is_https:
  #   Flags whether the protocol is HTTPS or HTTP.
  #
  # * http_meth:
  #   The method verb used in the client request.
  #
  # * url:
  #   The requested URL. Set in both the request and response.
  #
  # * resourceType:
  #   The filetype of the requested resource, or nil if the resource has no 
  #   filetype.
  #
  # * status:
  #   The HTTP status code returned by the server. This value is nil for 
  #   request messages.
  #
  # * req_content_type:
  #   The content-type string returned by the server. This value is nil for 
  #   request messages.
  #
  # * message:
  #   The full HTTP message.  
  #   **Ruby note: 
  #     For convenience, the message is received and returned as a ruby 
  #     String object. Internally within Burp it is handled as a java byte[] 
  #     array. See also the notes about the return object below.
  #
  # * action:
  #   An array containing a single integer, allowing the implementation to 
  #   communicate back to Burp Proxy a non-default interception action for 
  #   the message. The default value is ACTION_FOLLOW_RULES (or 0). 
  #   Possible values include:
  #     ACTION_FOLLOW_RULES = 0
  #     ACTION_DO_INTERCEPT = 1
  #     ACTION_DONT_INTERCEPT = 2
  #     ACTION_DROP = 3
  #
  #   Refer to the BurpExtender.java source comments for more details.
  #
  #
  # Return Value:
  #   Implementations should return either (a) the same object received
  #   in the message paramater, or (b) a different object containing a 
  #   modified message. 
  #
  # **IMPORTANT RUBY NOTE:
  # Always be sure to return a new object if making modifications to messages.
  #
  # Explanation: 
  # The (a) and (b) convention above is followed rather literally during type 
  # conversion on the return value back into the java BurpExtender.
  #
  # When determining whether a change has been made in the message or not, 
  # the decision is made based on whether the object returned is the same
  # as the object submitted in the call to evt_proxy_message. 
  #
  #
  # So, for example, using in-place modification of the message using range 
  # substring assignments or destructive method variations like String.sub!() 
  # and String.gsub! alone won't work because the same object gets returned 
  # to BurpExtender. 
  #
  # In short, this means that if you want modifications to be made, be sure
  # to return a different String than the one you got in your handler.
  #
  # So for example this code won't do anything at all:
  #
  #   ...
  #   message.sub!(/^GET /, "HEAD ")
  #   return message
  #
  # Nor this:
  #
  #   message[0..4] = "HEAD "
  #   return message
  #
  # But this will
  #
  #   ...
  #   return message.sub(/^GET /, "HEAD ")
  #
  # And so will this
  #
  #   ...
  #   message[0..4] = "HEAD "
  #   return message.dup

  # Prepares the java BurpExtender implementation with a reference

  ### Extra cruft added by Mr Bones:

  # Returns the library path for the module. If any arguments are given,
  # they will be joined to the end of the libray path using
  # <tt>File.join</tt>.

  def self.libpath( *args )

  # Utility method used to require all files ending in .rb that lie in the
  # directory below this file that has the same name as the filename passed
  # in. Optionally, a specific _directory_ name can be passed in such that
  # the _filename_ does not have to be equivalent to the directory.
  #
  def self.require_all_libs_relative_to( fname, dir = nil )

  end

end # Buby

unless Buby.burp_loaded?
